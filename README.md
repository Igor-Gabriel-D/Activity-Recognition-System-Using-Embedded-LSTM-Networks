# Activity-Recognition-System-Using-Embedded-LSTM-Networks
This project presents the implementation of a physical activity recognition system using embedded LSTM neural networks, capable of inferring movements from accelerometer data. The system collects information from inertial sensors, classifies activities, and transmits the data in real time.
